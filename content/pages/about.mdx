## What is hardpress?

Hardpress is a journey from concept to launch on how I stepped into my vision. It began as a seed, grew into a tree, and continues to shade others in inspiration. Its substance is my great and wonderful Lord, King Jesus. **The dream is the Gospel**. It's been in front of me the entire time.

>But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. ***We are hard pressed on every side***, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.
[^1]: [2 Corinthians 4:7-9, NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204%3A7-9&version=NIV)

This process has not been easy. Dying to self, loving the lost, forgiving sinners. It's impossible apart from Him. Many times I've wanted to quit. I've walked away, fallen short, doubted, and compromised, but I haven't given up. It pains me to write these words, but they're honest. 

## Isn't this another blog?

Yes, and no. I'm not speaking from opinion. Too much ink and blood have been shed for man's ideas. For things to change, the message of the Cross (Christ's death, resurrection, and return) must be proclaimed above all other truths.

>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
[^2]: [1 Corinthians 1:18, ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201%3A18&version=ESV)

There's much more that could be said, but I'd be taking away from what's been revealed already through Holy Scripture. Thanks for following along, but I'd rather have you press into Christ, and Lord willing, your own dream in Him.

I end my comments here.
