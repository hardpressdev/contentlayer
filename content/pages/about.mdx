## What is hardpress?

Hardpress is a journey from concept to launch on how I stepped into my vision. It began as a seed, grew into a tree, and continues to shade others in inspiration. Its substance is my great and wonderful Lord, King Jesus. **The dream is the Gospel**. It's been in front of me the entire time.

> But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. **We are hard pressed on every side**, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.

This process has not been easy. Dying to self, loving the lost, forgiving sinners. It's impossible apart from Him. Many times I've wanted to quit. I've walked away, fallen short, doubted, and compromised, but I haven't given up. It pains me to write these words, but they're honest. 

## Isn't this another blog?

Yes, and no. I'm not speaking solely from opinion, but experience. Too much ink and blood have been shed for man's ideas. For things to change, the message of the Cross (Christ's resurrection for fallen mankind) must be proclaimed above all other truths.

> For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

There's much more that could be said, but I'd be taking away from what's been revealed through Holy Scripture. Thanks for following the journey. Thanks for pressing in, and Lord willing, follow your own dream in Him.

> Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
