Humanity doesn't exist in a vacuum. Someone designed us with intention. To say otherwise is to deny the foundational principles of life and understanding. The *a priori* rule contends that knowledge justified independent of experience (such as reason or intuition) asserts, by definition, an objective truth claim to reality. In other words, what we *know* about truth is self-evident because of the need for an assertion itself.

God is. God spoke. These are the attributes of divine intelligence. We echo what we are and observe. I'm using plain speech to say: *We are intentionally made to know and serve the Creator, much like we would serve any authority on earth.*

Man can say they are authorities unto themselves, but they must still ontologically (the study of being) presuppose objectivity in their conclusion. This is circular by nature, but not infinite. The loop breaks down when an outside force, metaphysical in nature and superior in form, interacts with said authority and supersedes it dramatically.

What can we make of all this? That human beings, no matter how clever and well-intentioned, can ever claim to be God or to know all things. What follows, then, is not merely to prove the absence of God (*His being*), but to consciously assess what truth (*His Word*) and how it is observed in reality (*His ways*), specific to the human race.

By now, it's apparent there is voluminous evidence to support such a claim, but people are not moved by facts. They're moved by stories. True stories. Not fictions—which are made-up tales with a lesson—but real events with people who lived and testified to what they saw and heard.

In my quest to convey these simple yet profoundly personal observations, I will echo what our Lord and Savior did while dwelling on earth around 30 AD in Judea (modern-day Jerusalem).

Jesus spoke in parables (stories with hidden meaning) to communicate higher-dimensional realities.

> My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.
>
> — *John 18:36 (NISV)*

In other words, man is not capable of understanding (in their fallen natural state) the principles and operations of an eternal realm outside time and space.

Enter the Garden. What was really going on here? We learn from the opening chapters of the Bible that God wanted a family. A relationship. He created Adam (outside of time/space) and placed him in the Garden (bordering Heaven and Earth). He told him to take dominion over all created order, naming creatures and connecting with the Creator on a regular basis.

After a while, **God put Adam to sleep and created a woman from man.** Adam didn't know he `needed` a wife. This is a central aspect of our being. We often treat gifts from God as blessings, until they're burdens. It wasn't until later on in the narrative, when Eve is tempted by the satan (a disobedient angel who lies for selfish gain). Note: satan (Lucifer or the devil... he goes by many names) is often used as an instrument of God to bring rebellious sons back to Him.

Because of Adam and Eve's transgression, the consequence is their removal from God's presence. As a result, they're limited in physical and spiritual capacity, forced to wander the earth (which is also broken to an extent). This helps to explain many of the justice and free will issues we experience today because of sin.

It may seem fairly trivial and reductive to say all of created order has been impacted by this event (and inherently it is). I mean, hasn't modern science, evolution, and archaeological discoveries essentially disproved the God of the Bible? Surprisingly, no. The Biblical narrative for Creation actually meets muster. Does it explain everything? Not entirely, but that's not really the point of the Bible.

I realize this is a huge sticking point for most people. Why can't God just show up and fix all this, or why did He allow us to suffer through all this pain if He's such a "loving" creator? Understood. However, there is one conversation point that gets missed often.

We need redemption.

It's an ontological shock for many who come to faith in Jesus Christ. It's just not another religion or modality to get you through life's fears and uncertainties with eternal hope. Literally, when you wholeheartedly believe Jesus is God, and are truly "born again", he opens your eyes spiritually to know your own depravity. This isn't a natural thing, but a revelatory experiential encounter with the Divine. You literally 'wake up' and see fallen creation (people and the world systems) for what they are.

Some popular movies and books kinda get this right, even if they're borrowing themes and motifs from Holy Scripture.

For example, in the popular movie franchise, "The Matrix", the main character (Neo) is told by a friend and ally (Morpheus) about his state before being "freed" from the artificial reality that he (and all of humanity) has been imprisoned in.

> Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
> 
> Neo: What truth?
> 
> Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind. [1]

Now, without getting into the nuance of simulation theory and Eastern worldviews that the movie presents. By and large, it was a great film. You have, at its core, a redemption story with a messiah-like figure (similar to that of Frank Hebret's "Dune") who acts as a sort of redemptive hero to lead humanity to paradise.
