Humanity doesn't exist in a vacuum. Someone designed us with intention. To say otherwise is to deny the foundational principles of life and understanding. The *a priori* rule contends that knowledge justified independent of experience (such as reason or intuition) asserts, by definition, an objective truth claim to reality. In other words, what we *know* about truth is self-evident because of the need for an assertion itself.

God is. God spoke. These are the attributes of divine intelligence. We echo what we are and observe. I'm using plain speech to say: *We are intentionally made to know and serve the Creator, much like we would serve any authority on earth.*

Man can say they are authority unto themselves, but they must still ontologically (the study of being) presuppose objectivity in their conclusion. This is circular by nature, but not infinite. The loop breaks down when an outside force, metaphysical in nature and superior in form, interacts with said authority and supersedes it dramatically.

What can we make of all this? That human beings, no matter how clever and well-intentioned, can ever claim to be God or to know all things. What follows, then, is not merely to prove the absence of God (*His being*), but to consciously assess what is truth (*His Word*) and how it is observed in reality (*His ways*) specific to the human race.

By now, it's apparent there is voluminous evidence to support such a claim, but people are not moved by facts. They're moved by stories. True stories. Not fictions—which are made-up tales with a lesson—but real events with people who lived and testified to what they saw and heard.

In my quest to convey these simple yet profoundly personal observations, I will echo what our Lord and Savior did while dwelling on earth around 30 AD in Judea (modern-day Jerusalem).

Jesus spoke in parables (stories with hidden meaning) to communicate higher-dimensional realities.

> My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.

<p align="right"><i>(John 18:36, NISV)</i></p>

In other words, man is not capable of understanding (in their fallen natural state) the principles and operations of an eternal realm outside time and space.
