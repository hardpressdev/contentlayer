What we believe about...

What's fundamentally exclusive about the Judeo-Christian claims to reality is its corresponding features. Principally, regarding the nature of man (fallen; estranged from God), our need for restoration from sin (reconcilitation; Divine justice), and our principal subject of moral and spiritual salvation (Jesus Christ).

In the Gospels, Jesus shows us the Father. In the Prophets and Revelation, we get a portrait of Christ as Warrior King.
