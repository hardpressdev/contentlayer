How do you tell a story so compelling in a way that connects with readers of such diverse orders?

The only way to accomplish this feat truly is to focus on something universal that all of humanity can relate to. People connect on stories more than facts or opinions. But most of the stories we hear only rarely, if ever, give us answers to the most foundational questions of reality.  

We live in a time where man and machine are becoming closer than ever. Already, we have witnessed AI impact nearly every area of the globe. More breakthroughs in computing, science, and space exploration are before us. There's literally nothing beyond the realm of conceivable possibility.

Yet, with all these innovations, there's something fundamental to the human experience we lack. We feel it deep down. At the core of our being, there's this demand for justice, and the search for answers that is beyond the perceivable.

# What's the solution?

The heart of the Gospel is that God (humanity's architect) desired to know his Creation (us). The fulfillment of that promise is found in our `Messiah Jesus`, who came from outside time and eternity itself to restore us to the family of God that we left. As a species, this invitation is an exclusive invitation to those born from woman. We had this relationship in the beginning of time, lost it, and are desperately in need of it again.

For those who don't believe in this worldview claim, I hope that one day you will wake up to the reality that the world is incomplete, and that technology (no matter how sophisticated) will not solve this problem. I don't speak this from opinion, but raw experiential knowledge grounded in the revelation of Holy Scripture.

I hope you take this to heart. This is my unofficial author's note. Perhaps, the working title of this endeavor will be called, **`"Human"`**. Yeah, that's a good start.
